    	<h1>What do sloths eat?</h1>
    	<p class="lead">
        Sloths munch on leaves, twigs and buds. Because the animals donâ€™t have incisors, they trim down leaves by smacking their firm lips together. A low metabolic rate means sloths can survive on relatively little food; it takes days for them to process what other animals can digest in a matter of hours.</p>
